# üìö NLP Based Banking Chatbot

This is a **Banking FAQ Chatbot** where:

- The **frontend** is built using **Streamlit**
- The **backend** is powered by **FastAPI**
- The two are connected using **CORS**

---

## üöÄ Features

1. **Smart Query Response üß†**
   Provides intelligent answers to user queries using an intent prediction model.

2. **User Authentication üîê**  
   Users can sign up, log in, log out, and delete their account securely.

3. **Chat History Management üí¨**
   Stores each user's queries and chatbot responses in a SQLite3 database for persistence.

## üß† How It Works

- The chatbot **preprocesses** user input and vectorizes it using a **Bag of Words** model with ngram_range=(1, 2).
- The vectorized text is passed to a **Logistic Regression classifier** (multi_class='multinomial'), which achieves a **~94% test accuracy**.
- The model predicts the **intent probabilities**, and the intent with the **highest probability** is selected.
- To reduce hallucinations and increase response accuracy, a **confidence score threshold** is used.
- Based on the predicted intent, the bot picks a **random response** from a list of predefined replies for that intent.
- User data (username, password) and chat data (user input, bot response) are stored using **SQLite3**.
- Pydantic's BaseModel is used to define and validate **User** and **Chat** schemas.
